## Description

I was motived to build a README file generator to simplify the process of writing a README file. The README generator enables users to generate a README file effortlessly by answering a series of questions in Node JS. This project familiarised me with some of the modules available in Node JS such as Inquirer. It also taught me how to import functions from other script files, practice using arrow functions and retrieve response data. Please watch the [README Generator demo video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Irz5_BhiV5oCPaPDxW2-m3SoGFMuVSwI/view) to see it in practice.
